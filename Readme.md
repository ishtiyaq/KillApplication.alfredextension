Kill Application for Alfred
===========================

This is a extension that helps you killing any running application.

Installation
------------

To install the extension, you need [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) and its [Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/). Then, you just need to [download and open this file](http://victorpimentel.com/stuff/Kill%20Application.alfredextension).

How to use
----------

Once installed, you can use it in two ways, both based on the `kill` command:

- By directly writing the name of the application, for example:

    $ kill Twitter
    $ kill Finder
    $ kill Google Chrome

- By selecting first the application in Alfred, then pressing the right arrow and then writing `kill` (so that the _Kill Application_ action is selected).
